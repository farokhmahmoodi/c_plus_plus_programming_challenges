/*A sequence of integers such as 1, 3, 5, 7, â€¦ can be represented by a function that takes a non-negative integer as 
parameter and returns the corresponding term of the sequence. For example, the sequence of odd numbers just cited can be 
represented by the function

    int odd(int k) {return 2 * k + 1;}

Write an abstract class AbstractSeq that has a pure virtual member function

    virtual int fun(int k) = 0;

as a stand-in for an actual sequence, and two member functions

    void printSeq(int k, int m);
    int sumSeq(int k, int m)

that are passed two integer parameters k and m, where k < m. The function printSeq will print all the terms fun(k) through 
fun(m) of the sequence, and likewise, the function sumSeq will return the sum of those terms. Demonstrate your AbstractSeq 
class by creating subclasses that you use to sum the terms of at least two different sequences. Determine what kind of output 
best shows off the operation of these classes, and write a program that produces that kind of output.*/
