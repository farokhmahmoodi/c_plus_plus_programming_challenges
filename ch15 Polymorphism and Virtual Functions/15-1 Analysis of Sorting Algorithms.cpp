/*Design a class AbstractSort that can be used to analyze the number of comparisons performed by a sorting algorithm. The 
class should have a member function compare that is capable of comparing two array elements, and a means of keeping track of 
the number of comparisons performed. The class should be an abstract class with a pure virtual member function

void sort(int arr[ ], int size)
which, when overridden, will sort the array by calling the compare function to determine the relative order of pairs of 
numbers. Create a subclass of AbstractSort that uses a simple sorting algorithm to implement the sort function. The class 
should have a member function that can be called after the sorting is done to retrieve the number of comparisons performed.*/
