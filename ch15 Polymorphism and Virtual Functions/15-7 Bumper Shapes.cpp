/*Write a program that creates two rectangular shapes and then animates them. The two shapes should start on opposite ends of 
the screen and then move toward each other. When they meet in the middle of the screen, each shape reverses course and moves 
toward the edge of the screen. The two shapes keep oscillating and bouncing off of each other in the middle of the screen. 
The program terminates when the shapes meet each other in the middle for the tenth time.*/
