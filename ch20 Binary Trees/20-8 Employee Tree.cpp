/*Design an  class that holds the following employee information:  

Employee ID Number: an integer
Employee Name: a string

Implement a binary tree whose nodes hold an instance of the  class. The nodes should be sorted on the 
Employee ID number.

Test the binary tree by inserting nodes with the following information. 

Employee ID Number					Name
1021							John Williams
1057							Bill Witherspoon
2487							Jennifer Twain
3769							Sophia Lancaster
1017							Debbie Reece
1275							George McMullen
1899							Ashley Smith
4218							Josh Plemmons

Your program should allow the user to enter an ID number, then search the tree for the number. 
If the number is found, it should display the employee’s name. 
If the node is not found, it should display a message indicating so.*/
