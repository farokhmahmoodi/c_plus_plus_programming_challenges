/*Modify the binary search tree created in the preceding programming challenges by adding a member function that 
computes and returns the height of the tree.The height of the tree is the number of levels it contains. 
For example, the tree shown in Figure 20-10 has three levels. Demonstrate the function with a 
suitable driver program.
