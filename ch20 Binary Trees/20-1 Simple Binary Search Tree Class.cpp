/*Write a class for implementing a simple binary search tree capable of storing numbers. The class should have member functions

void insert(double x)
bool search(double x)
void inorder(vector <double> & v )

The insert function should not use recursion directly or indirectly by calling a recursive function.
The search function should work by calling a private recursive member function

bool search(double x, BtreeNode *t)

The inorder function is passed an initially empty vector v: it fills v with the inorder list of numbers stored in the binary search tree.
Demonstrate the operation of the class using a suitable driver program.*/
