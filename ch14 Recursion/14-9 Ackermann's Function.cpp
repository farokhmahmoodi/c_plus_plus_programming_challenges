/*Ackermann’s function is a recursive mathematical algorithm that can be used to test how well a computer performs recursion. 
Write a function A(m, n) that solves Ackermann’s function. Use the following logic in your function:

If m = 0 then  return n + 1
If n = 0 then  return A(m−1, 1)
Otherwise,     return A(m–1, A(m, n–1))
Test your function in a driver program that displays the following values:

A(0, 0) A(0, 1) A(1, 1) A(1, 2) A(1, 3) A(2, 2) A(3, 2)*/

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    

    return 0;
}
