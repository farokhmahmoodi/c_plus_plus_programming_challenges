/*Create a class that simulates and manages a soft drink machine. Information on each drink type should be stored in a structure 
that has data members to hold the drink name, the drink price, and the number of drinks of that type currently in the machine.

The class should have an array of five of these structures, initialized with the following data

.
Drink Name	Cost	Number in Machine
Cola	1.00	20
Root beer	1.00	20
Orange soda	1.00	20
Grape soda	1.00	20
Bottled water	1.50	20
The class should have two public member functions, displayChoices (which displays a menu of drink names and prices) and 
buyDrink (which handles a sale). The class should also have at least two private member functions, inputMoney, which is called by buyDrink to accept, validate, and return (to buyDrink) the amount of money input, and dailyReport, which is called by the destructor to report how many of each drink type remain in the machine at the end of the day and how much money was collected. You may want to use additional functions to make the program more modular.

The client program that uses the class should have a main processing loop that calls the displayChoices class member function and 
allows the patron to either pick a drink or quit the program. If the patron selects a drink, the buyDrink class member function 
is called to handle the actual sale. This function should be passed the patron’s drink choice. Here is what the buyDrink function
 should do:

Call the inputMoney function, passing it the patron’s drink choice.

If the patron no longer wishes to make the purchase, return all input money.

If the machine is out of the requested soda, display an appropriate “sold out” message and return all input money.

If the machine has the soda and enough money was entered, complete the sale by updating the quantity on hand and money collected 
information, calculating any change due to be returned to the patron, and delivering the soda. This last action can be simulated 
by printing an appropriate “here is your beverage” message.*/
