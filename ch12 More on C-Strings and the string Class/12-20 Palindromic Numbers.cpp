/*A palindromic number is a positive integer that reads the same forward as backward. For example, the numbers 1, 11, and 
121 are palindromic. Moreover, 1 and 11 are very special palindromic numbers: their squares are also palindromic. How many 
positive integers less than 10,000 have this property? Write a program to list all such numbers together with their squares.

The beginning part of your output should look like this:

1 has square 1
2 has square 4
3 has square 9
11 has square 121
22 has square 484

Hint: If str is a string object, the reverse() function (declared in <algorithm> header) will reverse the string. 
The code to do that is:

reverse(str.begin(), str.end());*/
