/*Write a program with three functions: upper, lower, and flip. The upper function should accept a C-string 
as an argument. It should step through all the characters in the string, converting each to uppercase. 
The lower function, too, should accept a pointer to a C-string as an argument. It should step through all 
the characters in the string, converting each to lowercase. Like upper and lower, flip should also accept a 
C-string. As it steps through the string, it should test each character to determine whether it is upper- or 
lowercase. If a character is uppercase, it should be converted to lowercase. If a character is lowercase, it 
should be converted to uppercase.

Test the functions by asking for a string in function main, then passing it to them in the following order: 
flip, lower, and upper.*/
