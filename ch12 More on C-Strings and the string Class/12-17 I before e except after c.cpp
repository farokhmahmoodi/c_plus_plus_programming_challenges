/*A friend of yours who is an educator is conducting research into the effectiveness of teaching the spelling rule 
“I before e except after c” to students. She wishes to analyze writing samples from two groups of students, only one 
of which was taught the rule. Write a program that will take a file containing a writing sample and print a list of 
all words in the file that contain at least one of the strings “ie” or “ei”.*/
