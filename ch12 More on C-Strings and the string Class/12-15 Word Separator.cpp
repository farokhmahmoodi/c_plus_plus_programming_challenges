/*Write a program that accepts as input a sentence in which all of the words are run together, but the first character 
of each word is uppercase. Convert the sentence to a string in which the words are separated by spaces and only the 
first word starts with an uppercase letter. For example the string “StopAndSmellTheRoses.” would be converted to “Stop and 
smell the roses.”*/
