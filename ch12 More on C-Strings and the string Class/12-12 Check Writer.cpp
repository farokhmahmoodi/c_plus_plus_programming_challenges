/*Write a program that displays a simulated paycheck. The program should ask the user to enter the date,
the payeeâ€™s name, and the amount of the check. It should then display a simulated check with the dollar
amount spelled out, as shown here:

                                 Date: 12/24/2016
Pay to the Order of: John Phillips           $1920.85
One thousand nine hundred twenty and 85 cents

You may assume the amount is no greater than $10000. Be sure to format the numeric value of the check in
fixed-point notation with two decimal places of precision. Be sure the decimal place always displays,
even when the number is zero or has no fractional part. Use either C-strings or string class objects in
this program.*/
