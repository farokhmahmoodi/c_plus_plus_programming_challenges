/*Write a program that creates a map containing course numbers and the room numbers of the rooms where the 
courses meet. The map should have the following key-value pairs:

Course Number (key)	Room Number (value)
CS101	3004
CS102	4501
CS103	6755
NT110	1244
CM241	1411

The program should also create a map containing course numbers and the names of the instructors that teach 
each course. The map should have the following key-value pairs:

Course Number (key)	Instructor (value)
CS101	Haynes
CS102	Alvarado
CS103	Rich
NT110	Burke
CM241	Lee

The program should also create a map containing course numbers and the meeting times of each course. The map 
should have the following key-value pairs:

Course Number (key)	Meeting Time (value)
CS101	8:00 a.m.
CS102	9:00 a.m.
CS103	10:00 a.m.
NT110	11:00 a.m.
CM241	1:00 p.m.

The program should let the user enter a course number, and then it should display the course’s room number, 
instructor, and meeting time.*/
