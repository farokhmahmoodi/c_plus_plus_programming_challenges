in cryptography plaintext is usually ordinary readable text before it is encrypted into ciphertext or readable text after it is decrypted
data input to or output from encryption algorithms is not always plaintext 
for example when data is superencrypted or encrypted more 
than once using different encryption algorithms only the input to the first encryption method is considered plaintext
