The first row shown has index 0, and the last row has index 6. Row 0 of the triangle 
consists of the single number 1. For any positive integer k, the row with index k has k + 1
numbers and starts and ends with a 1. For each position p other than the first and the last, 
the element at p in row k is the sum of the two elements of row (k − 1) at positions p and p − 1.

Write a function

vector<int> pascalTriangleNextRow(vector<int> row)

that takes a row of Pascal’s triangle in the form of a vector and returns the next row in the triangle. 
Test your function by writing a main function that asks the user to enter an integer N and prints the 
first N rows of Pascal’s triangle by repeatedly calling the above function.*/

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    

    return 0;
