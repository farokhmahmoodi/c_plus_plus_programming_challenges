/*A positive integer greater than 1 is said to be prime if it has no divisors other than 1 and itself. 
A positive integer greater than 1 is composite if it is not prime. Write a program that asks the user to 
enter an integer greater than 1, and then displays all of the prime numbers that are less than or equal to 
the number entered. The program should work as follows:

Once the user has entered a number, the program should populate a vector with all of the integers from 2, up 
through the value entered.

The program should then use the STL's for_each function to step through the vector. The for_each function 
should pass each element to a function object that displays the element if it is a prime number.*/
