/*Modify the SimpleVector class template, presented in this chapter, to include the member functions push_back and pop_back. 
These functions should emulate the STL vector class member functions of the same name. The push_back function should throw 
an exception if the array is full. The push_back function should accept an argument and insert its value at the end of the 
array. The pop_back function should accept no argument and remove the last element from the array. Test the class with a 
driver program.*/
