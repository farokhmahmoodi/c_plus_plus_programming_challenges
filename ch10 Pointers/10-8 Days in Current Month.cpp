/*Write a program that can determine the number of days in a month for a specified month and year. 
The program should allow a user to enter two integers representing a month and a year, and it should determine 
how many days are in the specified month. The integers 1 through 12 will be used to identify the months of January 
through December. The user indicates the end of input by entering 0 0 for the month and year. At that point, the program 
prints the number of days in the current month and terminates.

Use the following criteria to identify leap years:

A year Y is divisible by 100. Then Y is a leap year if and only if it is divisible by 400. For example, 2000 is a leap year but 2100 is not.

A year Y is not divisible by 100. Then Y is a leap year if and only if it is divisible by 4. For example, 2008 is a leap year but 2009 is not.

Here is sample run of the program:

Enter month and year: 2 2008[Enter]
29 days
Enter month and year: 0 0[Enter]

The current month, September 2009, has 30 days.*/

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;



int main()
{
    int month[12] = { 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 };



    return 0;
}
