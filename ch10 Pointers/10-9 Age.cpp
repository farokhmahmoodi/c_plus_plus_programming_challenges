/*Write a program that asks for the user’s name and year of birth, greets the user by name, and 
declares the user’s age in years. Users are assumed to be born between the years 1800 and 2099, and should 
enter the year of birth in one of the three formats 18XX, 19XX, or 20XX. A typical output should be “Hello 
Caroline, you are 23 years old.”*/
