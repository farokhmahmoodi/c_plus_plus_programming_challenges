/*Write a program that asks the user for the name of a text file. The program should display the 
last 10 lines of the file on the screen (the “tail” of the file). If the file has less than 10 lines, 
the entire file is displayed, with a message that the entire file has been displayed. The program should do 
this by seeking to the end of the file and then backing up to the tenth line from the end.*/
