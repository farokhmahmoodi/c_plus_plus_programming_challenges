/*This program should be designed and written by a team of students. Here are some suggestions:

One student should design function main, which will call other program functions or class member functions. 
The remainder of the functions will be designed by other members of the team.

The requirements of the program should be analyzed so each student is given about the same workload.

Write a program that uses a structure to store the following information about a customer account:

Name

Address

City, state, and ZIP

Telephone number

Account balance

Date of last payment


The structure should be used to store customer account records in a file. The program should have a menu that lets the 
user perform the following operations:

Enter new records into the file

Search for a particular customer’s record and display it

Search for a particular customer’s record and delete it

Search for a particular customer’s record and change it

Display the contents of the entire file

Input Validation: When the information for a new account is entered, be sure the user enters data for all the fields. 
No negative account balances should be entered.*/
