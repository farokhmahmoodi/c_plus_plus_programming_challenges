/*Design a class called NumDays. The class’s purpose is to store a value that represents a number of work hours and 
convert it to a number of days. For example, 8 hours would be converted to 1 day, 12 hours would be converted to 1.5 days, 
and 18 hours would be converted to 2.25 days. The class should have a constructor that accepts a number of hours, as well
as member functions for storing and retrieving the hours and days. The class should also have the following overloaded 
operators:

The addition operator +. The number of hours in the sum of two objects is the sum of the number of hours in the individual 
objects.

The subtraction operator −. The number of hours in the difference of two objects X and Y is the number of hours in X 
minus the number of hours in Y.

Prefix and postfix increment operators ++. The number of hours in an object is incremented by 1.

Prefix and postfix decrement operators −−. The number of hours in an object is decremented by 1.*/
