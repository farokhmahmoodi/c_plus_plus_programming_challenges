/*A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward. For example, the words mom, dad, madam, and 
radar are all palindromes. Write a class Pstring that is derived from the STL string class. The Pstring class 
adds a member function

bool isPalindrome( )
that determines whether the string is a palindrome. Include a constructor that takes an STL string object as parameter 
and passes it to the string base class constructor. Test your class by having a main program that asks the user to enter 
a string. The program uses the string to initialize a Pstring object and then calls isPalindrome() to determine whether 
the string entered is a palindrome.

You may find it useful to use the subscript operator [] of the string class: If str is a string object and k is an 
integer, then str[k] returns the character at position k in the string.*/
