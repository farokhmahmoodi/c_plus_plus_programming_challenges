/*Design a class Numbers that can be used to translate whole dollar amounts in the range 0 through 9999 into an English 
description of the number. For example, the number 713 would be translated into the string seven hundred thirteen, and 
8203 would be translated into eight thousand two hundred three.

The class should have a single integer member variable

int number;

and a collection of static string members that specify how to translate key dollar amounts into the desired format. 
For example, you might use static strings such as

string lessThan20[ ] =
    {"zero", "one", â€¦, "eighteen", "nineteen" };
string hundred = "hundred";
string thousand = "thousand";

The class should have a constructor that accepts a non-negative integer and uses it to initialize the Numbers object. 
It should have a member function print() that prints the English description of the Numbers object. Demonstrate the class 
by writing a main program that asks the user to enter a number in the proper range and then prints out its English 
description.*/

#include "Numbers.h"

int main()
{
    Numbers a(999);
    a.print();

    
    return 0;
}
