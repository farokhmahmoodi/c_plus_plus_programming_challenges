/*The following formula can be used to determine the distance an object falls due to gravity in a specific time period:
	d = 1/2 g * t ^ 2

The variables in the formula are as follows:

d is the distance in meters,
g is 9.8,
and t is the time in seconds that the object has been falling.

Write a function named fallingDistance that accepts an objectâ€™s falling time (in seconds) as an argument. 
The function should return the distance, in meters, that the object has fallen during that time interval. 
Write a program that demonstrates the function by calling it in a loop that passes the values 1 through 10 as arguments and displays the return value.
