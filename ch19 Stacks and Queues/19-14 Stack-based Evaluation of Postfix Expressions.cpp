/*Write a program that reads postfix expressions and prints their values.
Each input expression should be entered on its own line, and the program should terminate when the user enters a blank line.
Assume that there are only binary operators and that the expressions contain no variables. Your program should use a stack.
Here are sample inputâ€“output pairs:
        78                  78
        78 6 +              84
        78 6 + 9 2 - /      12
