/*A string may use more than one type of delimiter to bracket information into “blocks.”
For example, A string may use braces { }, parentheses ( ), and brackets [ ] as delimiters.
A string is properly delimited if each right delimiter is matched with a preceding left delimiter of the same type in such a way that either the resulting blocks of
information are disjoint or one of them is completely nested within the other.
Write a program that uses a single stack to check whether a string containing braces, parentheses, and brackets is properly delimited.*/
